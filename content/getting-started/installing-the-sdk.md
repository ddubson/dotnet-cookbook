The first step is to download and install the `.NET Core SDK`. 
This is the development kit for .NET that will be the engine for your application.

> If you're familiar with Java, `.NET Core SDK` is similar to `Oracle JDK`, `OpenJDK`, or the other billion JDK variants.

## Download and Install on MacOS

### Using Homebrew

The simplest way to obtain the .NET Core SDK on a Mac is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). 
Once you've downloaded and installed Homebrew, run the following command in your Terminal:

```bash
brew cask install dotnet-sdk
```

### Downloading directly

Navigate to <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Core downloads page</a> 
and install the MacOS version of the latest .NET Core SDK.
