There are quite a few options for Integrated Development Environments
for .NET Core. Below are some of the options:

## JetBrains Rider

JetBrains' Rider IDE is an optimal choice for developing .NET Core applications.

Some of its features include:

- Support for running .NET Core applications via configurations
- Full C# language support
- Code style support for C#
- Magnificent auto-complete functionality
- Full debugging support (Mono)
- Common test framework integrations

You can download JetBrains Rider via:

- [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/)
- [Direct Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (or simply VS Code) has excellent support for development of .NET Core 
applications.

Much of the support for the environment is in the form of additional plugins.
A very useful pack of plugins is [Awesome DotNetCore Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salbert.awesome-dotnetcore-pack)

You can install it via:

```bash
brew install visual-studio-code
```
