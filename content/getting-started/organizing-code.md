To keep it really simple, `.NET Core` code is divided into two bundling strategies:

**Projects** and **Solutions**

A `project` is a set of bundled source code files | defined by an `.csproj` file

A `solution` is a collection of projects and acts as a mediator between the projects it holds | defined by an `.sln` file

Here's a visual example:

```markdown
NeverendingTeaShop/
   src/
      NeverendingTeaShop.API
      NeverendingTeaShop.Application
      NeverendingTeaShop.Domain
      NeverendingTeaShop.Infrastructure
      NeverendingTeaShop.Persistence
   tests/
      NeverendingTeaShop.API.Tests
      NeverendingTeaShop.Core.Tests
      NeverendingTeaShop.Infrastructure.Tests
   NeverendingTeaShop.sln
```

The top level directory is a solution called **NeverendingTeaShop**,
defined by the existence of the file `NeverendingTeaShop.sln`.
`.sln` files are solution definition files auto-generated by the .NET Core CLI.

The **NeverendingTeaShop** holds the three source projects

- **NeverendingTeaShop.API**
- **NeverendingTeaShop.Core**
- **NeverendingTeaShop.Infrastructure**

and three respective test projects (where all your test code lives)

- **NeverendingTeaShop.API.Tests**
- **NeverendingTeaShop.Core.Tests**
- **NeverendingTeaShop.Infrastructure.Tests**

Test code is split from source code so there's no mixing of production artifacts
and test artifacts.

The above is an example of a clean architecture convention as created by a reference architecture found here:
