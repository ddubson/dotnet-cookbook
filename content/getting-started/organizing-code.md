To keep it really simple, `.NET Core` code is divided into two bundling strategies:


**Projects** and **Solutions**

A `project` is a set of bundled source code files | defined by an `.csproj` file

A `solution` is a collection of projects and acts as a mediator between the projects it holds | defined by an `.sln` file

> It is important to note that you keep your tests separate from your actual production code.

Here's a visual example:

```markdown
GoodProduct/
   src/
      GoodProduct.API
      GoodProduct.Core
      GoodProduct.Infrastructure
   tests/
      GoodProduct.API.Tests
      GoodProduct.Core.Tests
      GoodProduct.Infrastructure.Tests
   GoodProduct.sln
```

The top level directory is a solution called **GoodProduct**, defined by the existence of the file `GoodProduct.sln`. 
`.sln` files are solution definition files auto-generated by the .NET Core CLI.

The **GoodProduct** is holds the three source projects 

- **GoodProduct.API** 
- **GoodProduct.Core**
- **GoodProduct.Infrastructure**

and holds three respective test projects (where all your test code lives)

- **GoodProduct.API.Tests** 
- **GoodProduct.Core.Tests**
- **GoodProduct.Infrastructure.Tests**

> Test code is split from source code into separate projects. This makes building and packaging source code a bit more
> straightforward.

The above is an example of a clean architecture convention as created by a reference architecture found here:
