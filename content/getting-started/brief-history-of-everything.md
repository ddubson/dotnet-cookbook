## .NET Standard

The .NET Standard is a unified collection of specifications that are tailored to have cross-platform implementations 
as described above. This allows us to use the same stack to develop for many different operating systems and devices.

If you're wondering what should I use to build my application, start by asking what you want to build:

|I want to build...|then I'll use...|
|------------------|----------------|
|an MVC web app         |[.NET Core]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/))|
|an web api             |[.NET Core]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/))|
|a native Windows app   |[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)|
|a mobile Android app   |[Xamarin.Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/index)|
|a mobile iOS app       |[Xamarin.iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/index)|

All the above frameworks and runtimes adhere to the .NET Standard
